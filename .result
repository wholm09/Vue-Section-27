Briefly explain your approach and possible challenges you overcame.

The solution video explains the path I took to solve the problem laid out in the "problem" video. You can find the finished code attached.

It can be challenging to decide which code should go into its own component and which code should be part of another component. 

Try to decide that on a logical basis: Does your code (template/ HTML + JS) have its own business logic? Is it a logical unit of your project? If yes, it might be worth thinking about creating a new component for that piece of code. If not, leave it in the component it currently is in.
